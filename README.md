# Pizza Tower '19 Plus: SAGE 2024 Demo Decompilation

 A Decompilation of Pizza Tower 19 Plus (SAGE 2024)

This Decomp works, but still needs work internally (organization)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The FMOD API for Windows (or whatever platform you're on) is required for successful compilation
>
> Unless you remove the pre and post build .bat files, but you won't have sound 

GameMaker Version Used: 2024.2

## Current Progress

Everything works fine, but

- Organization is needed
- States aren't Enums
- Arrow Keys Icon fails to display

and that's kinda it

### Thanks to
- QuantumV, for his decompiler
- 6ZzwjdpNgL, for the original decompilation
> That's his actual name, idk why, but yeah

- The 19 Plus Developers, for making the Mod

Note that none of the people mentioned above know me/know I even made this decomp
> they probably would also probably hate me if they knew I existed
